								<ol>Rahul is a Right-handed batsman who can occasionally do wicket-keeping as well. He is a flexible batsman. He opens the batting in T20Is and Tests and currently plays in middle order for India in ODIs. A tall, elegant right-hand batsman who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batsmen in India's next generation.[13]He is naturally an aggressive batsman who can switch the gears according to the situation."He (Rahul) has been absolutely terrific in the last couple of IPLs. Look at the rate at which he has been scoring and he plays authentic cricket shots. He plays the occasional scoop or reverse sweep but, because he has got all the normal cricketing shots in the book, he doesn’t have to resort to these other shots."—Sunil Gavaskar, November 2021

									Brian Lara heaped praise for KL Rahul, when he was asked to name the current batsman who he loves to watch.
									"That's easy, KL Rahul. If you are talking about the two teams that are playing, KL Rahul is definitely someone for me who I would pay to watch bat. I just love watching KL Rahul. Especially in the T20 version of the game, when you see a guy batting with the technique and ability to score runs with traditional batting shots, it's just exceptional to watch.He is an interesting one for me because if you wind the clock back 2 or 3 years ago, he was probably more an out-and-out technically correct Test match batsman. But what he has been able to do with his T20 batting in the last two IPLs, has been absolutely unbelievable. He is turning himself now to be a better white-ball player than he is a Test match player and that doesn't happen very often."
